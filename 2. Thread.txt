----------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is Listener?
kind of report showing result
before you run listener, try with single thread

1. View Results Tree (most important)
2. Aggregate Report
3. Graph Results

---------------------------------

1. View Results Tree
specific case: green tick mark status 200 and got pass from results tree, but actual response is wrong

---------------------------------

2. Aggregate Report
-Samples: number of user
-Throughput: number of request that are processed per time by server (request/time)
		thread up = throughput up
		larger throughput is better => keep on increasing more user
		fixed throughput after increasing number of thread => maximum ability
-90% line: 90% of samples took no more than this time

----------------------------------

3. Graph Result
-Deviation: shows exceptional case (deviating)
-Throughput: ideally throughput should increase as thread increase
