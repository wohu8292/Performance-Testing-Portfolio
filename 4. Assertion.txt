4.Listener> Assertion Results
---------------------------------------

1. Response Assertion

text response> contains> add (result tree 에서 assertion 할 응답 확인할것)

you can't manually type response, whereas response code can be typed

if you want to add assertion on childredn request, choose sub-sample

---------------------------------------

2. Size Assertion

how much size of request in byte? (result tree 에서 확인할것)

3000 > (greater than 3000)

if the request can handle 100 requests that means 100* [size in bytes from sampler result] are written by server side

it's problem when response is not with complete size of bytes due to heavy load, so size in bytes shouldn't go down 

----------------------------------------

3. Duration Assertion

Load Test => how much it will take?

Load time 체크 (result tree 에서 확인할것)
